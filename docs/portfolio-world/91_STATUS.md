# 91. Portfolio World — Project Status

Updated: 2026-09-16

## Phase
FOUNDATION / SPRINT 0B ACCEPTED / MAIN MERGE PENDING

## Current Work Unit
Sprint 0B — Merge and Verification Closeout

## Confirmed
- MyPage repo 유지
- optional World
- GitHub Pages main/root 유지
- `/MyPage/world/` 후보
- M01 제약 비적용
- Library v1 Deferred
- role = Director
- v1 scope canonical = `03_REQUIREMENTS.md`
- Phaser 4.2.1 + Vite 8.3.0 + TypeScript 7.0.2 runtime foundation implemented
- `world/` production build path configured for `/MyPage/world/`
- Work Context v0 implemented with distinct profile and machine-context detection
- Sprint 0B F1/F2/F3 remediation implemented and validated
- Sprint 0B — ACCEPTED
- Runtime Foundation — COMPLETE
- Work Context v0 — COMPLETE
- Main merge — PENDING CLOSEOUT

## Known Technical Follow-ups

- Phaser bundle size exceeds Vite's 500 kB warning threshold; track a performance budget in a later Sprint.
- `skipLibCheck` remains enabled for Phaser 4.2.1 / TypeScript 7 declaration compatibility; `src/**` remains strict.

## Next
1. Merge Sprint 0B into `main`
2. Verify main and GitHub Pages deployment source state
3. Begin Sprint 1 planning only after closeout completes
