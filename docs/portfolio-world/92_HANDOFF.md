## Runtime code
FIRST PLAYABLE WORLD SKELETON IMPLEMENTED

## Implementation

- Commit: `fea4828`
- Fixed logical game: 1024 × 576; World: 2048 × 1280
- Player: 24 × 32 px programmatic placeholder; W/A/S/D + Arrow movement, delta-time, normalized diagonal, opposing-key cancellation, manual bounds clamp
- Movement baseline: 200 px/sec, accepted by Human Feel Test
- Camera: bounded follow, 0.15 / 0.15 lerp, rounded pixels
- Accessibility: `../` Portfolio return link, game ARIA region, visible focus state, coarse-pointer fallback
- Validation: `npm ci`, typecheck, build, test, preview, Work Context, and diff check PASS

## Sprint 2 Status

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE
INDEPENDENT REVIEW PENDING
HUMAN FEEL TEST PENDING

## Implementation

- Project-owned layout data provides 64 px primary paths, 256 × 128 px destination footprints, 64 px forecourts, eight reusable-placeholder landmark placements, and non-collidable edge treatment.
- North/South destinations now use the required `LOGICAL_UNIT * 7` offset. West/East coordinates were retained.
- Arcade Physics has dynamic Player / static environmental collision only. The manual world-edge clamp remains authoritative.
- No binary art assets, Tiled data, routing, or content payloads were added.

## Next

Independent review, then user Human Feel Test for density, wayfinding, and collision.
